# Stories behind traffic accidents

## Introduction

Imagine what kind of state you would be in if a strong beam of light came flying towards you, followed by a strong feeling of impact. If you are lucky, maybe when you open your eyes, you will still be able to see the world in front of you, but if it is unfortunate, maybe you will never be able to open your eyes again. You should have guessed that it was a traffic accident. There have been many news stories about car accidents on cbs news, for example on August 22, 2023, the first day of elementary school, a school bus carrying children crashed killing one child and injuring the remaining 23 children. On January 12, 2023, just after 6:00 a.m., a semi-truck driver caused a six-vehicle crash in Arizona that killed five people, and was on the phone and actively using "TikTok" before the crash. Traffic accidents are a widespread and concerning phenomenon that occurs every day globally. Accidents caused a series of devastating injuries and, sadly, even fatalities. The impact extends beyond individuals to entire families. Given the profound consequences of these accidents on society, they have long been a pressing concern for global communities. Our team members unanimously recognize the urgency of addressing this issue, and as such, we are interested in exploring the stories behind these traffic accidents occurring in the United States. Therefore, target audience of our story are drivers involved in traffic accidents in the United States.

Each member of our group chose one or more factors associated with car accidents to study.

Part I (Shuxin Dong): 
Firstly, may I ask if you went out during the Thanksgiving holiday season a while ago? Did you all travel by car? Do you have your own cars, or did you rent a car to go out? During the Thanksgiving holiday, I went to Leavenworth and drove there by renting a Zipcar. If you've ever rented a car, you'll know that there's an extra fee charged specifically for young people called the young driver fee. Most car rental companies will charge this to drivers under the age of 25. So why would young drivers be charged this extra amount? We can speculate that it is because these rental car companies believe that young people are more likely to get into accidents that result in damage to their cars. Is this fee charged by the rental car companies reasonable? Is it true that young drivers are more likely to get into accidents? This is what I am interested in and would like to explore, especially for people younger than 25.

Part II (Shuxin Dong):
The mention of female drivers brings back memories of my childhood. When I was a student, my family drove me to school, and on the road I would occasionally encounter slow-moving or unexpectedly stalled vehicles. Whenever this happened, a speculative voice would ring around me: "It's a female driver, isn't it? This leaves me with the impression that women may not be as skillful drivers as men, and that female drivers are more likely to be involved in traffic accidents than male drivers. However, I am keen to analyze the data to find out whether this perception is a stereotype or the actual situation. Therefore, female drivers will be our target audience for this study.

Part III (Sehrish):
Embarking on a journey through the intricate layers of data, we unveil a rich tapestry that holds the secrets to understanding the complex dynamics of alcohol-related incidents. Imagine it as a puzzle—a puzzle that, once solved, grants us the wisdom needed to shape comprehensive strategies for a safer tomorrow.

Intrigued by the interplay between variables, my curiosity led me to unravel the impact of alcohol on vehicular collisions. Picture this: we're not just crunching numbers; we're exploring the fascinating relationships between alcohol involvement, gender disparities, and the severity of injuries. Are more females entangled in alcohol-related incidents than their male counterparts? And what about the aftermath—do crashes involving alcohol lead to more severe injuries?

These questions aren't just statistical inquiries; they hold the key to public safety. The potential correlation between alcohol involvement and injury severity serves as a beacon, guiding us towards the urgent need for measures to curb alcohol-impaired driving. Our findings become the compass for crafting policies, refining law enforcement practices, and launching public awareness campaigns that aim not just to inform but to actively reduce the gravity of injuries in road accidents.

This report doesn't stop at presenting mere statistics; it immerses you in the intricate dance between alcohol, gender, and injury severity in vehicular collisions. By tackling these questions head-on, the report seeks to offer actionable insights for policymakers, law enforcement, healthcare professionals, and the wider community. Unraveling the subtleties of alcohol-related incidents isn't just a task—it's a vital mission, a commitment to targeted interventions, and a pledge to safeguard lives on our roads.


Part IV (Xiangcheng Ji):
Delve into the heart of my research as we unravel the fascinating interplay of driver age, weather whimsy, and ticking clocks on the likelihood and severity of traffic crashes. Why is it worth your attention? Because these factors are more than just variables; they are the cornerstones of road safety, the keys that unlock safer, smoother journeys for all of us.

Imagine: exploring the unexpected, venturing into the realm where age, weather and time dance together, exploring the laws waiting to be discovered in a symphony. Does the energy of a young driver burst onto the road at night, a story told in the light of the streetlamps? And how does the cosmic ballet of raindrops or snowflakes change the storyline?

It's not just about research questions, it's about peeling back the layers of the daily commute to find the rhythms that echo across our roads. Join me in my quest for revelations embedded in every curve in the data. After all, understanding the dynamics of these factors is not just a matter of academic curiosity; it's a matter of reshaping the fabric of road safety.
